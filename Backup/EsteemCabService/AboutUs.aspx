            Founded in 1923, Esteem Cab is one of the oldest cab companies in Long beach metro area. Esteem Cab is always leading the way in improving its cab service through adopting state-of-the art technology. Esteem Cab has always looked at ways to help improve its taxi cab services.Before the use of two-way radios, Esteem Cab set up telephone stations for the drivers to use to get their next order.

            <br />

            <p>In the 1950′s, Esteem Cab installed two-way radios in all its cabs to increase the dispatch speed. In 1963, Esteem Cab installed a second two-way radio in every cab to help the dispatcher know if the driver’s meter was on. This helped the dispatcher find and schedule the next available cab thereby increasing the dispatching speed significantly.

            Today Esteem Cab, and its fleet of owner/operator taxi cabs, many of which are utilizing greener technology,  use the most advanced dispatching system on the market. The use of GPS (Global Positioning System), automated call ordering and Mobile Data Terminals has resulted in one of the fastest response times by any cab company.
